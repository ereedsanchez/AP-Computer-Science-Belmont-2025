# Array Algorithms in Processing
## Class Instructions

### Welcome!
Welcome to this hands-on workshop on array algorithms using Processing. This class focuses on common array manipulation techniques that frequently appear on AP Computer Science A Free Response Questions (FRQs).

### Materials Provided
1. **Student Handout** - Overview of each algorithm with examples and exercises
2. **Starter Code** - Template code with function signatures for you to complete
3. **Test Case Framework** - Code to verify your implementations work correctly

### Class Flow (2 Hours)

#### Introduction (10 minutes)
- Brief overview of array basics in Processing
- Connection to AP CSA FRQs
- Setup Processing and open starter code

#### For Each Algorithm Section (Approximately 15-20 minutes each):
1. **Instructor Demonstration** (5 minutes)
   - Explanation of the algorithm pattern
   - Visual demonstration where applicable
   - Common variations and applications

2. **Guided Implementation** (5-10 minutes)
   - Complete the provided starter function together
   - Discuss edge cases and optimizations
   - Run test cases to verify

3. **Individual Practice** (5 minutes)
   - Complete a variation of the algorithm on your own
   - Opportunity to ask questions

#### Final Challenge (15 minutes)
- Work independently or in pairs on the challenge problem
- Apply multiple algorithm patterns together

#### Wrap-up (5 minutes)
- Review key takeaways
- Q&A session
- Resources for further practice

### Getting Started

1. **Setup Your Environment**
   - Open Processing
   - Create a new sketch
   - Copy the starter code into your sketch

2. **Structure Your Work**
   - Implement one algorithm at a time
   - Test each function before moving to the next
   - Take notes on algorithm patterns and techniques

3. **Testing Your Code**
   - The `setup()` function includes test cases
   - Run the sketch to see test results in the console
   - Expected output is provided in the handout

### Tips for Success

- **Read carefully**: Understand what each function should do before coding
- **Think step-by-step**: Trace algorithm execution with small examples
- **Edge cases**: Always consider empty arrays and arrays with just one element
- **Debug incrementally**: Add print statements to see intermediate values
- **Ask questions**: Don't hesitate to ask for clarification or help

### Algorithm Checklist

As you complete each algorithm, check it off:

- [ ] Accumulator Pattern (Sum/Average)

### Expected Learning Outcomes

By the end of this class, you should be able to:
- Implement common array algorithms from scratch
